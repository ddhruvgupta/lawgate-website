# Introduction to Delay Analysis

Delay analysis is a critical component of construction claims, helping to establish causation, responsibility, and entitlement for time extensions and associated costs.

## Common Delay Analysis Methods

### 1. As-Planned vs As-Built Analysis

This method compares the original baseline program with the actual progress to identify delays.

**Advantages:**
- Simple and easy to understand
- Requires minimal documentation

**Limitations:**
- Does not show cause and effect
- Cannot distinguish between concurrent delays

### 2. Impacted As-Planned Analysis

This method inserts delay events into the original baseline program to demonstrate their impact.

**Advantages:**
- Shows theoretical impact of delays
- Useful when contemporaneous records are limited

**Limitations:**
- Based on hindsight
- May not reflect actual project conditions

### 3. Time Impact Analysis

A prospective method that inserts delay events into the contemporaneous program at the time they occurred.

**Advantages:**
- Most accurate method
- Shows cause and effect relationship
- Contemporaneous analysis

**Limitations:**
- Requires detailed contemporaneous records
- Time-consuming and complex

### 4. Windows Analysis

Divides the project into time windows and analyzes progress in each window.

**Advantages:**
- Handles complex projects effectively
- Can identify concurrent delays

**Limitations:**
- Requires comprehensive programming data
- Labor-intensive

## Key Considerations

When conducting delay analysis:

1. **Quality of Records:** Ensure comprehensive contemporaneous documentation
2. **Choice of Method:** Select appropriate methodology based on available data
3. **Concurrent Delays:** Properly identify and apportion concurrent delays
4. **Expert Opinion:** Engage qualified delay analysts
5. **Contract Requirements:** Consider contractual provisions for delay claims

## Best Practices

- Maintain detailed project records throughout the project
- Update project programs regularly
- Document delay events as they occur
- Engage experts early in the claims process
- Consider multiple analysis methods for verification

## Conclusion

Proper delay analysis is essential for successful time-related claims. Understanding various methodologies and their applications helps parties present compelling arguments in dispute resolution proceedings.
