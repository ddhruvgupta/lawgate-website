# What is Construction Arbitration?

Construction arbitration is a form of alternative dispute resolution where parties submit their disputes to one or more arbitrators who make a binding decision. It offers a private, flexible alternative to court litigation.

## The Arbitration Process

### 1. Commencement

The arbitration process typically begins when one party serves a notice of arbitration on the other party, referencing the arbitration clause in their contract.

### 2. Appointment of Arbitrators

Parties select arbitrators based on their expertise in construction law and technical knowledge. The number of arbitrators (sole arbitrator or tribunal) is usually specified in the contract.

### 3. Preliminary Meeting

A preliminary meeting establishes the procedural framework, including:

- Timeline for proceedings
- Document disclosure requirements
- Expert witness procedures
- Hearing dates and format

### 4. Evidence and Submissions

Both parties present their case through:

- Written submissions and pleadings
- Documentary evidence
- Expert reports
- Witness statements

### 5. Hearings

Oral hearings allow parties to present arguments, examine witnesses, and respond to opposing submissions. Hearings can be conducted in person or virtually.

### 6. Award

The arbitral tribunal issues an award that is final and binding on the parties. Awards are generally enforceable in courts under international conventions.
